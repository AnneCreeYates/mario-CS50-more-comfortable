# mario-CS50-more-comfortable
This is the solution to the CS50 mario (more comfortable) pset1 project.
The code is in C and it contains additional libraries that work only in CS50 IDE (#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>).
The code requests the user to provide a positive integer beteween 1 and 8 inlcusive and then prints out 2 triagles with 2 spaces inbetween.
Example:
Height: 5
    #  #
   ##  ##
  ###  ###
 ####  ####
