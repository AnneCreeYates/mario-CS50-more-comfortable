# mario-CS50-more-comfortable
This is the solution to the CS50 mario (more comfortable) pset1 project.
The code is in C and it contains additional libraries that work only in CS50 IDE (#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>).
The code requests the user to provide a positive integer between 1 and 8 inclusive and then prints out 2 triages with 2 spaces in-between.
Example:
$ ./mario
Height: 4
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
